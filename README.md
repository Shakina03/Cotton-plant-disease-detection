# Cotton-plant-disease-detection
Using Kaggle load the dataset images and then using StreamLit load the seperate coding files and work on them.
Crafted a user-friendly interface, reducing user errors and increasing in prediction of cotton plant diseases accurately from input images using Kaggle.  
Using CNN model and the images processing techniques we analyse the leaf images, extract the features of leaf then predicts the diseases and also recommend the pesticides.  
Implemented dynamic features, enhancing user flexibility and satisfaction.
